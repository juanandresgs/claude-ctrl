  "report": "# I-SOON (Anxun Information Technology) and Associated APT Groups\n\n## Company Overview\n\nI-SOON (also known as Anxun Information Technology Co., Ltd.) is a Chinese cybersecurity company based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The company was founded in 2010 and has operated as a private contractor providing offensive cyber capabilities to various Chinese government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the Ministry of State Security (MSS), and the People's Liberation Army (PLA).\n\nIn February 2024, a massive leak of internal documents from I-SOON was posted on GitHub, providing unprecedented insight into China's commercial hacking-for-hire ecosystem. The leak included internal communications, sales pitches, product documentation, and victim data.\n\n## Key Findings from the Leak\n\n1. **Government Clients**: I-SOON sold hacking tools and services to at least 43 distinct Chinese government bureaus across 31 provinces.\n2. **Target Scope**: The company targeted governments, telecommunications companies, and organizations in at least 20 countries including India, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and NATO.\n3. **Capabilities**: Products included remote access trojans (RATs) for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android; email phishing platforms; and tools for penetrating Wi-Fi networks.\n4. **Revenue Model**: Charged between $15,000 and $800,000 per target, depending on the difficulty and value of the target.\n\n## Associated APT Groups\n\n### APT41 (Winnti Group / Double Dragon)\n- Strong links to I-SOON through shared infrastructure and tooling\n- Known for both espionage and financially motivated operations\n- Targets: healthcare, telecoms, technology, video games\n\n### Chengdu 404 Network Technology\n- Closely related entity also based in Chengdu\n- Several employees indicted by US DOJ in 2020\n- Overlap with APT41 operations\n\n### POISON CARP\n- Linked to targeting of Tibetan groups\n- Used I-SOON infrastructure for campaigns against diaspora communities\n\n### Additional Connections\n- Evidence of relationships with groups tracked as RedHotel, RedAlpha, and Fishmonger\n- Some researchers have linked I-SOON to operations attributed to APT groups targeting Southeast Asian governments\n\n## Impact and Aftermath\n\nThe leak prompted investigations by Chinese authorities and led to increased scrutiny of China's hacker-for-hire industry. In March 2024, the US Department of Justice indicted several individuals connected to I-SOON operations. The leaked documents remain one of the most significant exposures of a state-sponsored hacking contractor's operations.",

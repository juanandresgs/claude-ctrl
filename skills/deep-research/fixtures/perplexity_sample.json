  "report": "# I-SOON: China's Hacking Contractor Exposed\n\nI-SOON (Anxun Information Technology) is a Shanghai-registered, Chengdu-based Chinese cybersecurity firm that was dramatically exposed in February 2024 when an anonymous source leaked thousands of internal documents on GitHub.\n\n## What We Know About I-SOON\n\n**Corporate Structure**: Founded around 2010, I-SOON operated as a government contractor providing offensive cyber operations. The company employed approximately 600 people and maintained offices in multiple Chinese cities. CEO Wu Haibo (\"Shutdown\") was previously active in early Chinese hacking communities.\n\n**Business Model**: I-SOON functioned as a hacker-for-hire operation, bidding on government contracts to compromise specific targets. Their pricing ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars per engagement, with a la carte pricing for different target types.\n\n**Capabilities Revealed**:\n- Custom RATs (Remote Access Trojans) for all major platforms\n- Twitter/X account hijacking tools\n- Custom hardware devices for Wi-Fi exploitation\n- Email compromise and monitoring platforms\n- Automated vulnerability exploitation frameworks\n\n## APT Associations\n\n### Confirmed Links\n- **APT41/Winnti**: Strongest documented connection. Shared tooling, infrastructure, and likely personnel overlap.\n- **Fishmonger/Aquatic Panda**: ESET researchers linked I-SOON directly to the Fishmonger threat group, which is associated with operations targeting governments in Asia and Europe.\n\n### Probable Links\n- **RedAlpha**: Credential phishing operations targeting Tibetan and Uyghur communities show infrastructure overlap with I-SOON.\n- **POISON CARP**: Mobile malware campaigns targeting Tibetan diaspora connected through shared C2 infrastructure.\n- **ShadowPad users**: I-SOON documents reference ShadowPad, the modular backdoor shared among multiple Chinese APT groups.\n\n### Circumstantial Links\n- Operations attributed to **APT10**, **APT17**, and **Mustang Panda** show some tooling similarities, though direct I-SOON involvement is not confirmed.\n\n## Notable Victims\n- Government agencies in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea\n- NATO communications (referenced in leaked documents)\n- Telecommunications companies across Southeast Asia\n- Hong Kong democracy activists and Tibetan organizations\n\n## Post-Leak Developments\n- February 2024: Leak appears on GitHub\n- March 2024: US DOJ issues indictments against I-SOON-connected individuals\n- Chinese authorities reportedly launched investigation into the source of the leak\n- Several I-SOON employees went dark on social media\n- The company's website was taken down",

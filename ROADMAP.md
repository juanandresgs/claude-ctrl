# Claude System Roadmap

**Strategic Planning for Claude Code AI Command Framework**  
Version 2.0+ Development Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The Claude System has successfully transitioned from an over-engineered memory management system to a clean, modular SuperClaude framework. This roadmap outlines the evolution path from current stable state (v2.0) through planned enhancements and future vision.

## Current State (v2.0) ✅ Complete

### What We Have
- **SuperClaude Framework**: 16 commands with wave orchestration
- **11 AI Personas**: Domain-specialized behavior patterns with auto-activation
- **MCP Integration**: Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright servers
- **8-Step Quality Gates**: Comprehensive validation pipeline
- **Simple Backup System**: Non-intrusive conversation archiving
- **Clean Architecture**: No shell hijacking, user-controlled activation

### Lessons Learned
- **Simplicity Wins**: Simple tools are more maintainable than complex ones
- **User Control Matters**: Manual activation preferred over automatic behavior
- **Core Functions Are Sacred**: Don't override basic shell operations
- **Modularity Prevents Failure**: Independent components can fail safely

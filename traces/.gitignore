# traces/.gitignore — defense-in-depth against accidental trace commits
#
# Trace data contains project paths, session IDs, agent response text, and
# code diffs. This must NEVER be committed to the public upstream repo.
# The root .gitignore already excludes traces/ but this file provides a
# second layer of protection even if the root ignore is modified or bypassed.
